        <h3>How did Robbie become my pet?</h3>
        <p>Robbie Rotten finished his run on the show Lazy Town, and he was let go from the studio. Tired and poor from his villainous work,
            he wandered the streets for weeks before I found him in the area between Northside Terrace, Race Hall and Myers Hall late one 
            night. I saw that he was cold and hungry, so I took him in. As a person with free will, he decided to stay after he had fully 
            recovered. He's a little weird, so he prefers being pet over being talked to.
        <h3>States and stimuli</h3>
        <p>He can occupy several states that are decided by his hunger and happiness, and random chance. Hunger and happiness decrease 1 
            per second. Pressing the pet button adds 25 to happiness, and pressing feed adds 50 to hunger.<br>

        <h3>From one programmer to another</h3>
        <p>Adding to this program is really simple. Taking it for yourself is as simple as changing the names of the .jpeg pictures and 
            the states list. That is, if you plan on keeping the hunger and happiness bars. I intentionally made it so these were external 
            numbers, so I ran into the problem of being able to change them outside of pressing the buttons. To address this, I made the 
            textareas completely ignore key presses. 
        <p>Furthermore, adapting it for your own use is as simple as chaning the variables and the math within the function simulate(). 
            Making functions based on what you want the buttons to do is as simple as deleting pet() and feed() and replacing them with 
            your own functions. As long as they're placed here and attached to the correct buttons using ID's, you're good to go.
