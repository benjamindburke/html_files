    <center><h1> CARDIAC - CARDboard Illustrative Aid to Computation</h1></center>
    <p> I know why you're here! CARDIAC was just covered, and now you have to do a lab with it.
        You don't care about the history of CARDIAC, so I'll spare it. 
        You just need to know how it works, and I can help with that.
        CARDIAC is a computing aid used primarily to help students understand assembly language and machine language. 
        It has 100 memory addresses, labeled 00 through 99. 
        Locations 00 and 99 are filled by default.
        Location 99 contains "8" followed by two other symbols by default, and Location 00 always contains "001" which is used in a process called "bootstrapping."
        More on this process later.

    <h2> The Basics to Computing with CARDIAC</h2>
    <p> CARDIAC's machine language uses 10 different commands to complete processes.
        These commands are labeled 0 through 9.

    <p> But how are these operations used?
    <p> CARDIAC commands are 3 digit non-negative operations made of two parts:
    <p><ul>
      <li> The first digit is 0-9 to determine the operation
      <li> The last two digits are 00-99 to determine the memory location the operation is performed on
      </ul>
    <p><center><img src="cardoperations.jpg"></center>   
    <p> Most operations are pretty simple and intuitive, but if you wish to know more, you can read on the intricacies of each operation at <a HREF="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardiac.html"> Brian Stuart's CARDIAC webpage</a>.
    <p> Now that we're beginning to understand how the operation codes work, let's open up Brian Stuart's handy <a HREF="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/museum/cardsim.html">CARDIAC simulator</a>.
        When the webpage opens up, this is what you will see.
    <p><center><img src="cardsim.jpg"></center>
    <p> Let's learn the different parts of the simulator so we can start wriitng programs.
	Memory is exactly what the name says, but deck, reader, CPU, accumulator and output haven't been discussed yet.
        To make it simple, the deck is your input.
        Press load to move it to the reader. 
        This readies your input for the program to operate with.
	The PC number under CPU should be set to the location of your first operation so your program actually runs.
	It's good practice to start at PC 10.
	If your program does something really weird, try checking the PC.
	The accumulator is one of two things that your program will operate with. 
	The other is a memory location.
	Output is simply the result of the program.
    <h3>Writing a program </h2>
    <p> So you're probably thinking to yourself, "how in the hell do I get this thing to work?"
	It's much simpler than you think. 
	In fact, the simplicity is what throws students off. 
	They're expecting it to be much harder than it is.
    <p>	Let's start with 3+2, very elementary. 
	But how do we tell CARDIAC we want to add two numbers together?
	Let's break it down into parts: 3, + and 2.
	First, we need to store these numbers somewhere so they can be referenced.
	The locations don't really matter, so let's use 04 and 05 for simplicity.
	We'll store 003 in Location 04 and 002 in Location 05. 
	Let's load 003 using our CLA operation, opcode 1. 
	104 will load the data located in Location 04 into the accumulator.
	This tells CARDIAC "do operation 1 on 04", which puts 003 in the accumulator.
	To add, we'll use our ADD operation, opcode 2.
	205 will add the data located in Location 05 to the accumulator. 
	Since 003 is in the accumulator, adding 002 will change the accumulator to 005.
	You've done the operation 3+2, but you aren't done yet.
	The data needs to be stored somewhere.
	Again, location is arbitrary, so let's store it in Location 06.
	To do that, we'll need to use STO, opcode 6.
	606 will store the accumulator, "005," into Location 06.
	Now, we need to output it so CARDIAC finally tells us that 3+2 does indeed equal 5.
	TO do that, we'll use OUT, opcode 5.
	506 will output Location 06, which contains the number "005."
    <p> Pretty simple, right? It just takes a while to do.
	The major thing to understand: <b> opcodes perform their functions on the two digit location that follows them. </b>
    <p> The assembly language breakdown of 3+2: <br>
	DATA &nbsp; n<br>
	DATA &nbsp; m<br>
	CLA &nbsp; n<br>
	ADD &nbsp; m<br>
	STO &nbsp; sum<br>
	OUT &nbsp; sum<br>
    <p> The machine language used to do 3+2: <br>
	04	&nbsp;	003 <br>
	05	&nbsp;	002 <br>
	10	&nbsp;	104 <br>
	11	&nbsp;	205 <br>
	12	&nbsp;	606 <br>
	13	&nbsp;	506
    <p> It's easy to get lost in the simplicity sometimes. 
	These are just the basics, so use your knowledge to create more complex programs.
    <hr>
    <h2>Bootstrapping</h2>
    <p>	Bootstrapping, or booting, is the process in which the program writes itself and executes.
	So how would someone bootstrap in CARDIAC?
    <p> It's pretty simple, but it's important to understand how it's done. By default, the PC starts at 00. 
	Again by default, 00 contains 001, which if it's ran, it will initialize 01 to something.
	So here's the first trick: a loop must be created where the program revisits location 00.
	To do that, we load 800 into location 02. 
	This will cause the loop to put a different operation into location 01, which will cause the program to fill its own locations with the operations you want it to perform.
    <p> And how do we stop it? 
	After your last operation, end it with loading 810 into location 02 to begin the program.
	Test values can follow this operation.
    <p> Bootstrapping example of 3+2: <br>
    <p> 002<br>
	800<br>
	004<br>
	003<br>
	005<br>
	002<br>
	010<br>
	104<br>
	011<br>
	205<br>
	012<br>
	606<br>
	013<br>
	506<br>
	014<br>
	900<br>
	002<br>
	810<br>
    <p> Take the time to go step-by-step. 
	Watch the program loop from 00 to 02 and slowly fill the locations with the operations.
	Bootstrapping is pretty simple, but it's incredibly important to understand how it's actually done.
    <p> Bootstrapping for dummies: <ol>
      <li> 002
      <li> 800
      <li> location
      <li> operation
      <li> repeat 3-4 until there are no more operations
      <li> 002
      <li> 810
      <li> test values (if there are any) </ol>
